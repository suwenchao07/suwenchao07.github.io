Abstract

Estimating contaminant source has become increasingly important to hazard assessment and emergency management of air contaminant nowadays. In this paper, a source estimation method is proposed to estimate the location and release rate of source. The theoretical basis of this source estimation method is Bayesian inference using the atmospheric dispersion model, Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) and the observed data. An improved Gaussian dispersion model is proposed to model the continuous emission source. In order to obtain the observed data, a UAV-based air contaminant sensory system is developed consisting of an aerial platform and a sensory system. An experiment is conducted in a chemical industry park to verify the feasibility and credibility of this UAV-based system. Furthermore, the source estimation method proposed recovers the location and release rate of source with a high accuracy, confirming the effectiveness of the method.
