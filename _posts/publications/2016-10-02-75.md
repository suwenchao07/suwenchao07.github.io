Abstract

WeChat is a widely used online social media application in China for its popularity. Based on the analysis of big HTML5 data from WeChat, the Geography Interaction Activity Network (GIAN) is acquired first in this paper. Then we analyze the geographical characteristics of WeChat network through the community detection in GIAN. It is concluded that the cities in the same community stay close geographically usually, and the WeChat networks can be partitioned into communities in which there are five communities that are stable and contains the majority of cities in China.
