Abstract

WeChat becomes the China's most widely used online social media application because of its convenience and simplicity. This paper is based on the records of HTML5 web pages that spread in WeChat. The propagation network G is constructed with these records. Then, according to the city where a Web user is, the network is divided into small networks within the city Gi (In-city Networks) and the networks Gij between any two cities (Out-city Networks). Based on the analysis of Gi and Gij, a WeChat propagation net-work model with geographic information is established. This net-work model has the characteristics of WeChat propagation and geographic information. This work can support the online opinion propagation researches with geographical characteristics.
