Abstract

The construction of transportation 5.0 or the so-called society-centered intelligent transportation systems (ITS) has aroused higher requirements for the intelligent sensing capability to seamlessly integrate Cyber-Physical-Social Systems (CPSS). Crowd Sensing Intelligence (CSI), as a promising paradigm, leverages the collective intelligence of heterogeneous sensing resources to gather data and information from CPSS. Our first Distributed/Decentralized Hybrid Workshop on Crowd Sensing Intelligence (DHW-CSI) has been focused on principles and high-level processes of organizing and operating CSI. This letter reports the discussion results of the second DHW-CSI addressing the participants, methods, and stages of CSI for ITS. We categorized sensing participants into three kinds, i.e., biological , digital, and robotic. Then we summarized three methods to enable sensing intelligence, i.e., foundation models, scenarios engineering, and human-oriented operating systems. Finally, we anticipated that the progression of CSI will experience three stages, from algorithmic intelligence to linguistic intelligence, and eventually to imaginative intelligence.
