Abstract

Studying the source term estimation methods of pollution in chemical clusters is effective to avoid accidents, since biochemical disasters have brought great loss to human beings. Safety monitoring of chemical industry parks was modeled via unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV) monitoring system, inverse problem model, ridge regression model, and particle swarm optimization algorithm. Based on that, a practical case was given to analyze results of experiment. Research findings are helpful for risk assessments and emergency management.
