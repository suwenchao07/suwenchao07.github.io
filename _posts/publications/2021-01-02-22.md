Abstract

Safety refers to the stable external environment and orders wherein society and citizens need to engage in and conduct normal life, work, study, entertainment, and communication. Resilience in public safety refers to the ability to withstand the shocks and pressures of emergencies. Emergency management is the creation of plans through which communities decrease the impact of disasters and prevent from unexpected events. GIS models and simulation capabilities are used to exercise response and recovery plans during non-disaster times. They help the decision-makers understand near real-time possibilities during an event. For example, while global communities are trying to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic, GIS tools are widely used by health departments, safety and emergency management authorities and wider professionals around the world for gathering and analyzing data to support informed decisions.
