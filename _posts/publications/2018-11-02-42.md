Abstract

Chemical production activities in industrial districts pose great threats to the surrounding atmospheric environment and human health. Therefore, developing appropriate and intelligent pollution controlling strategies for a management team to monitor chemical production processes has been a surge of interests in a chemical cluster. Patrolling is scheduled for better detecting irregularities of chemical plants. However, the current patrolling strategies fail on competing with intelligent chemical plants and therefore can be non-optimal. Therefore, the Chemical Cluster Environmental Protection Patrolling (CCEPP) game is investigated in this paper. The game incorporating source estimation methods aims at detecting emission violation behaviors of chemical plants by intelligently scheduling the patrolling routes. The model is further illustrated by a case study.
