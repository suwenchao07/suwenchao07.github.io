Abstract

As an approach to solve the problems in complex system research, ACP (Artificial Society, Computational Experiments, Parallel Execution) has played an important role in research fields such as public safety. With the development of information technologies such as big data, intelligent learning, game play theory, an intelligent ACP based experimental approach was proposed to solve the kernel problems in current complex system research. The possibility analysis of the approach in public safety, biological threats and joint combat experiments was illustrated. The applications including evacuation, network opinion and chemical industrial park security of the approach in safety science were given. As a result, the application and thinking of intelligent ACP based experimental approach in more research fields are needed in future work.
