Abstract

Safety is crucial for people, and emergency management helps keep people safe. Emergency management involves four stages: Planning and Mitigation, Preparedness, Response and Recovery. Geospatial applications (including GIS) have been extensively used in each stage of emergency management. Decision-makers can utilize the geospatial information to develop planning and mitigation strategies. GIS models and simulation capabilities are used to exercise response and recovery plans during non-disaster times. They help the decision-makers understand near real-time possibilities during an event. Once disaster occurs, GIS will take effect in real time response and recovery activities
