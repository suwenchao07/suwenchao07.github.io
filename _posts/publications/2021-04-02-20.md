Abstract

We investigate the route choice behavior of pedestrians under the condition of local view by using a field observation in a subway station and a microscopic pedestrian model with discrete space representation. The local view of a pedestrian means that the pedestrian's field of vision can be blocked by obstacles. Several typical phenomena with respect to behavior affected by the local view of pedestrians are observed through recording the movement of pedestrians in the subway station. Based on these observed phenomena and behaviors, a route choice model considering the effect of local view of pedestrians is developed. In the model, an algorithm for dividing feasibly vision areas is formulated. Two algorithms for computing the potential fields are then developed based on the results of dividing feasibly vision areas. By numerical experiments, the simulation results of the model are compared with the empirical observations to validate the model.
