Abstract

Modeling human behaviors considering the dynamic environment caused by toxic gas release, and its impact on the moving human in risk assessment of emergency incident are very important. Though, a plenty of researches have been done to analyze the impact of toxic gas, under whose influence, human evacuation behavior has not been thoroughly analyzed, especially, the dynamic path planning behavior considering the diffusion of toxic gas and human movement behavior after breathing in toxic gas. The two-layer evacuation modeling framework is extended by integrating toxic gas dispersion and its lethal damage model to give a more real representation of evacuation behavior under the influence of toxic gas dispersion. Then, a hypothetical scenario of sarin toxic gas release on a square is used as the case study to compare the results of ��threat-aware�� strategy (the proposed approach) and ��threat-unaware�� strategy (a previous dynamic approach) with regard to the individual-centered indices and spatial-centered indices. The simulation results show that there are significant differences between above two indices, which suggests that the proposed model serve to improve the process of risk assessment of the impact of toxic gas on the moving humans.
