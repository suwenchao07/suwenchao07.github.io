excerpt: Strategy evaluation and optimization in response to troubling urban issues has become a challenging issue due to increasing social uncertainty, unreliable predictions, and poor decision-making. To address this problem, we propose a universal computational experiment framework with a fine-grained artificial society that is integrated with data-based models. The purpose of the framework is to evaluate the consequences of various combinations of strategies geared towards reaching a Pareto optimum with regards to efficacy versus costs. As an example, by modeling coronavirus disease 2019 mitigation, we show that Pareto frontier nations could achieve better economic growth and more effective epidemic control through the analysis of real-world data. Our work suggests that a nation’s intervention strategy could be optimized based on the measures adopted by Pareto frontier nations through large-scale computational experiments. Our solution has been validated for epidemic control, and it can be generalized to other urban issues as well.

Abstract

Strategy evaluation and optimization in response to troubling urban issues has become a challenging issue due to increasing social uncertainty, unreliable predictions, and poor decision-making. To address this problem, we propose a universal computational experiment framework with a fine-grained artificial society that is integrated with data-based models. The purpose of the framework is to evaluate the consequences of various combinations of strategies geared towards reaching a Pareto optimum with regards to efficacy versus costs. As an example, by modeling coronavirus disease 2019 mitigation, we show that Pareto frontier nations could achieve better economic growth and more effective epidemic control through the analysis of real-world data. Our work suggests that a nation’s intervention strategy could be optimized based on the measures adopted by Pareto frontier nations through large-scale computational experiments. Our solution has been validated for epidemic control, and it can be generalized to other urban issues as well.
