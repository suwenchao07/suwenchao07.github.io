Abstract

In the domain of research on climate change, the study of its impact on national security has drawn a surge of interests in recent years. Therefore, it is essential to develop a model which can determine a country's stability level, especially for the weak country, and simultaneously measure the influence of climate change. However, most of the current assessment models focus on the changes in objective factors (e.g., climate) but ignore the influence of state managers' initiative. To remedy the drawback, this paper proposes a national security assessment model which takes the climate impacts, national governance capacity and the initial condition of state into consideration. Further, three metrics are qualified by the Entropy method, including the Climate Change Index, the National Governance Influence Index and the Initial Fragility Condition. Then, the entropy method is employed to calculate abovementioned metrics precisely. Subsequently, after determining the value of the abovementioned metrics, the SIS mode is introduced to qualify the safety level of a country through differential equations. Finally, the model is further verified by a series of experiments and related discussions are concluded.
