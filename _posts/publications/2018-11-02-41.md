Abstract

Air pollution caused by industrial production has become a serious problem for public health. This challenging problem promotes the development of the research in the air contaminant dispersion (ADS) prediction, for the management of the emission and leak accident. However, conventional ADS models can hardly meet the requirement of both accuracy and efficiency. The data model, like the artificial neural network (ANN) provides a feasible way of forecasting the dispersion with high accuracy and efficiency. However, the construction of the ANN for prediction needs plenty of data, which is impractical to obtain in most emission cases. To address this problem, an ADS simulation software AermodSystem is applied to build the simulated dispersion scenarios and provide synthetic dataset for the model training and test. Based on the synthetic data set, the ANN prediction model is established, and evaluated on the test set, as well as the Gaussian model. Further, these two models are served as the forward dispersion model and combined with the Particle Swarm Optimization (PSO) for source estimation. The results verify the effectiveness of the proposed model and indicate that the ANN together with the AermodSystem as the data generator is feasible in the air contaminant dispersion forecast and the source estimation of a particular case.
