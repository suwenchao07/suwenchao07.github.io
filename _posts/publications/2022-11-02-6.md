Abstract

With the rapid growth of connected and autonomous vehicles (CAVs), vehicular crowdsensing (VCS) has emerged as an effective way in a wide range of applications, especially in intelligent transportation systems. However, centralized VCS frameworks have confronted many problems, such as privacy, security, utility, and dependability. To remedy these challenges, blockchain technology can be applied in VCS systems for effectively forming decentralized autonomous vehicles organizations and operations. This article briefly introduces blockchain-based VCS solutions addressing the current problems and presents potential directions for future research.
