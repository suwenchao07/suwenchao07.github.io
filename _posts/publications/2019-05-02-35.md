Abstract

Spatial interaction is the process that individuals interact with each other at different geographical locations. It attracts much research interests for the increasing data and applications related to spatial interaction. In this paper, a method is proposed to construct the Spatio-info Network with dataset from WeChat. The correlation between human factors and statistics characteristics of the network is analyzed and confirmed, then the GDP (Gross Domestic Product) and demographics are integrated into gravity model to model the Spatio-info Network. The likelihood method is used to solving the parameters and evaluate the four models, it is found that GGD (GDP-GDP-Distance), PPD (Population-Population-Distance) are similar and much better than the other two models. Finally, topological characteristics and community structure of evolution network are analyzed to evaluate the models. It is found that evolution networks of the two models are almost consistent to origin network, and PPD models is better. It is concluded that gravity model and human factors can be used to model the Spatio-info Network. The work can be used to predict the communication amount of different regions in online social media dynamically. Naturally, this will help the mobile communication infrastructure construction, especially for a new generation of technology such as 5G, or for regions with poor infrastructure. And it will also help software service providers configure server and advertising resources.
