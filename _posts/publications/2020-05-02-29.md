excerpt: "In a sudden hazardous material leakage accident, the rapid and accurate localization of the leakage source can effectively reduce casualties and property losses. Utilizing the sensible robot to seek an unknown emission source has become a promising field, while most researches in this field fail to consider some intractable but practical factors, s..."
