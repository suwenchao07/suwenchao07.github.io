Abstract

Studying large-scale pedestrian evacuation is essential to nuclear leakage incident, since nuclear incidents have brought great loss to mankind. This paper models the large-scale evacuation under nuclear leakage incident via atmospheric dispersion model and pedestrian evacuation model. Based on this, an synthetic Fukushima accident is given to analyze simulation results. Research findings are helpful for risk assessments and emergency management.
