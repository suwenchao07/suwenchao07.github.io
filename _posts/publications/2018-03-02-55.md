Abstract

Locating and quantifying the emission source plays a significant role in the emergency management of hazardous gas leak accidents. Due to the lack of a desirable atmospheric dispersion model, current source estimation algorithms cannot meet the requirements of both accuracy and efficiency. In addition, the original optimization algorithm can hardly estimate the source accurately, because of the difficulty in balancing the local searching with the global searching. To deal with these problems, in this paper, a source estimation method is proposed using an artificial neural network (ANN), particle swarm optimization (PSO), and a simulated annealing algorithm (SA). This novel method uses numerous pre-determined scenarios to train the ANN, so that the ANN can predict dispersion accurately and efficiently. Further, the SA is applied in the PSO to improve the global searching ability. The proposed method is firstly tested by a numerical case study based on process hazard analysis software (PHAST), with analysis of receptor configuration and measurement noise. Then, the Indianapolis field case study is applied to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method in practice. Results demonstrate that the hybrid SAPSO algorithm coupled with the ANN prediction model has better performances than conventional methods in both numerical and field cases.
